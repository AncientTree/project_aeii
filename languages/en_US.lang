P_WIKI_ABOUT_L1=Ancient Empires Reloaded is a fan game created by toyknight starting from 2014. The original game Ancient Empires II was a legend back to Symbian time. This remastered version is mainly for showing respect to that lost age. For more information, please check the links below.

P_WIKI_BATTLE_BASICS_L1=Now you have a troop ready for battle, but before rushing to the enemies you should know about how the battle works.
P_WIKI_BATTLE_BASICS_L2=There are two 2 attack/defence types in this game: physical & magic. Each unit has one specific attack type and 2 separate defence types.
P_WIKI_BATTLE_BASICS_L3=Usually units have different physical and magic defences, so you will need to choose your opponents wisely to maximize damage output.
P_WIKI_BATTLE_BASICS_L4=Damage calculation here is very simple. Generally speaking the final damage equals to:
P_WIKI_BATTLE_BASICS_L5=(ATK - DEF) * HP%
P_WIKI_BATTLE_BASICS_L6=Anyway there can be some modifiers applied to this final damage, which are related to unit abilities. Please pay attention to that.

P_WIKI_GAMEPLAY_OVERVIEW=This section will give you some simple but necessary guides on the game system, but only as simple as they are. It's up to you to develop your own strategy using the information you got. Should you have any confusion about how the system works, please go here.

P_WIKI_INCOME_RECRUIT_L1=First thing first, to defeat enemies you need a troop, and to form up a troop you will need to recruit units which costs gold.
P_WIKI_INCOME_RECRUIT_L2=There are 2 ways you can earn gold: occupying villages/castles or keeping your commander alive. Income will be calculated & gained when your turn starts.
P_WIKI_INCOME_RECRUIT_L3=To recruit new units you can simply click your castle. But please note that you can do recruiting only when no unit is on the castle, except your commander.
P_WIKI_INCOME_RECRUIT_L4=While recruiting new units you should pay attention to their cost and occupancy, to make sure that it will not cause troubles for your future plans.

P_WIKI_STATUS_L1=Despite terrains, you can also utilize status to win battles. There are positive as well as negative status, but a unit can have only one status at a time. Once a unit gets a status, it will not be replaced with another ones.
P_WIKI_STATUS_L2=That being said, sometimes having a negative status is not always bad since it can prevent the unit from getting worse status. Anyway, positive status are always good.
P_WIKI_STATUS_L3=Be cautious that, standby on tombstones will attach [Poisoned] status to units for 1 round. (except units who have necromancer ability)

P_WIKI_STATUS_OVERVIEW=All status details are listed here. Feel free to check whenever you feel confused.

P_WIKI_TERRAINS_L1=Most of the terrains will provide defence bonus to units. But usually terrains with higher defence bonus will require more movement points to go through.
P_WIKI_TERRAINS_L2=Keep in mind that some abilities will let units gain additional attack/defence bonuses while on specific type of terrains, sometimes even movement point cost will be affected.

P_WIKI_UNITS_OVERVIEW=You can find all basic units information here, including their abilities. Anyway unit attributes growths are not included in here, try to find them by yourself :)
